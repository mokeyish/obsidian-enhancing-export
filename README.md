This is an enhancing export plugin base on `Pandoc` for Obsidian ([https://obsidian.md/](https://obsidian.md/)). It's allow you to export to formats like `Markdown`,`Markdown (Hugo)`,`HTML`,`docx`,`Latex` etc.

Where `Markdown`,`Markdown (Hugo)`,`HTML` will export and its media resource together.

**Noteï¼š**  `Markdown`,`Markdown (Hugo)`,`HTML` are tested in Mac OS, Windows, and Linux as I used it for myself, others are not tested well.
